This repo is a PyTorch implementation for the graduation project related to the multi-head network on domain adaptation task.
* The folder 'HeatNet' contains the codes for the reproduction work of HeatNet. The files 'train.py', 'test.py' and 'two_stage_train.py' are implemented by ourselves based on the original paper, and 'train.py' is for the training without two-stage strategy. The files 'heatnet_train.py' and 'heatnet_test.py' are implemented according to the code of the original paper, and our results are got from this implementation.
* The folder 'Siamese' contains the codes for the experiment of the single-head network with maximum squares loss.
* The folder 'multi-head' contains the codes for all experiments related to multi-head network. The file 'train_baseline.py' is for the training of the single-head network with adversarial learning strategy, which is considered as a baseline experiment. 'train_multitask.py' is for the experiment of the basic multi-head network on RGB-to-thermal adaptation, and 'train_multitask_v2.py' is for the basic model with the modified decoder. The file 'train_dn.py' is for the training of the basic multi-head network on daytime-to-nighttime adaptation, and 'train_dn_v2.py' is for the basic model with the modified decoder and 'train_dn_v3.py' is applying the pre-trained weights from RGB-to-thermal adaptation to Version 2.
