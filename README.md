This repo is released for the graduation project related to the multi-head network on domain adaptation task.
* The folder 'HeatNet' contains the codes for the reproduction work of HeatNet. The files 'train.py', 'test.py' and 'two_stage_train.py' are implemented by ourselves based on the original paper, and 'train.py' is for the training without two-stage strategy. The files 'heatnet_train.py' and 'heatnet_test.py' are implemented according to the code of the original paper, and our results are got from this implementation.
